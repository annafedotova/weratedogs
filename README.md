[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account dedicated to rating dogs in a humorous way. Each tweet contains a caption introducing the dog and is accompanied by a photo or a video. The last line of the tweet usually contains the rating of the dog, where the denominator is normally 10, while the numerator is almost always greater than 10. Why?
