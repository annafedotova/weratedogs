# WeRateDogs tweets analysis

## Introduction

[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account dedicated to rating dogs in a humorous way. Each tweet contains a caption introducing the dog and is accompanied by a photo or a video. The last line of the tweet usually contains the rating of the dog, where the denominator is normally 10, while the numerator is almost always greater than 10. Why? Because "[they're good dogs Brent](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)".

It was started in November, 2015 and has grown to more than 7.5 million followers over the past 3 years (as per January, 2019). In this project, we will focus on the tweets for the period betweeen November, 2015 and July, 2017.
